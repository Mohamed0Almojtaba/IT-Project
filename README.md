This project is a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation that connects two company branches through proper routing, VLANs, and subnetting. Both branches are fully networked and connected to the internet, with secure internal communication between departments.

Key features include:

Two Interconnected Branches: Linked using static or dynamic routing to enable communication between sites.

VLAN Configuration: Implemented to separate departments within each branch (e.g., HR, Admin, IT) for better traffic management and security.

IP Subnetting: Proper subnetting ensures efficient IP address usage across the network.

Internet Access: Both branches are connected to a simulated ISP to provide internet access to all devices.

IoT Integration (Branch 1): Smart appliances such as lights, fans, and sensors are controlled through an IoT server, simulating smart office automation.

This project demonstrates core networking skills including topology design, routing configuration, VLAN setup, subnet planning, and IoT device integration.
