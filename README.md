This project is a complete network simulation built using Cisco Packet Tracer. It models two company branches connected through routing, VLANs, and subnetting. Both branches have full internet access and internal communication, and the setup includes a mix of traditional and smart devices.

ðŸ”§ Main Features:
Two Branches
Each branch is connected using routing (static or dynamic), allowing seamless communication between them.

VLANs & Subnetting
VLANs are set up to separate departments (e.g., HR, IT, Sales), combined with subnetting to manage IP space efficiently.

Internet Connectivity
Both sites connect to a simulated ISP for global access.

VoIP Integration
IP phones are configured with a working VoIP setup, including a call manager for internal communication.

Multiple Switches & Devices
Each branch includes multiple switches to manage traffic and support device scalability.

Printers & Office Equipment
Networked printers are accessible across departments.

IoT Devices in Branch 1
Smart appliances (lights, fans, sensors) controlled via an IoT server demonstrate modern smart office integration.
